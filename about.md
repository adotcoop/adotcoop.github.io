## about me

An information security professional working in end user computing, I've worked in two of the largest universities in Scotland for just over 20 years.

At these organisations I've been responsible for architecting, deploying and maintaining managed desktops and the infrastructure that supports them. 

Here's some badges - the CCE-V has expired but I was quite good at designing Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops once upon a time.
