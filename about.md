## About me

For over 20 years I've worked at two of the three largest universities (but not _the_ largest) in Scotland. At these organisations I've been responsible for architecting, deploying and maintaining managed desktops and the infrastructure that supports them. 

At University of Glasgow I was chief architect for their SCCM infrastructure, including designing the OSD Task Sequences for their primary desktop models. I was also architect for their Citrix XenDesktop solution.

At University of Strathclyde I lead a team that has been responsible for architecting and deploying SCCM, redesigning the incumbent active directory OU structure and group policies. Within 12 months and at the first attempt we achieved Cyber Essentials Plus certification across our managed desktop portfolio. My team is also responsible for Intune and WVD design and implementation.

## About this site

This site focuses on the main technologies I know about -  SCCM (MEMCM), Intune, VDI (WVD _and_ Citrix) and Windows. For a while I did a bit of Information Security and became a CISSP so there might be a bit of cybersecurity thrown in.
